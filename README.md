# Denoising-of-3D-and-fractal-images-using-polynomial-thresholding

The primary goal of this project is to compare the efficacy of different denoising algorithms on 3D biomedical images and fractals using 3D wavelet transform. The principle mechanism of denoising is to the mitigation of Gaussian noise of different variances using polynomial thresholding [2]. 

In project, the focus is to study the effects by applying the same algorithms on noisy fractal images. For observatory control experiment purposes, denoising is done on both 3D biomedical images and 3D solids. Box counting dimension was used as a performance metric to determine how close the denoised image was to the original image.
